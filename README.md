# Cplusplus-Program

This project is a baisc investment calcuator. It's intent is to allow a user to get a idea how compounding intrest with monthly deposits can add up over a set amount of time.
This project creates instances of the month object to track the growth over time. 
It will be enhanced in the future by allowing the user to retrieve data at a certain point. As of this having each month saved is not nessasary but will be after additonal options are added. 
It was most dificult for me to find an efficient way to write the displays. I will go back and try to condense the code required for displays.
The most transferable skill displayed in this project is the use of OOP. It is an extremely common form of abstraction that can be used in may different applications.
The way that I made this code readably and easy to maintain was throught the use of fuctions. I was able to keep the Main() short and simple relying primarily on fuction calls.
